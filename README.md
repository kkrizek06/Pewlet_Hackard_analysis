**Overview of the analysis:**
The purpose of this analysis is to pull data from many csv files to create new csv files using SQL. We created multiple queries to identify employees that are close to retiring. The intent is to provide the employer with information regarding employees who are on their way out with respect to their job titles.

**Summary** 

**o	How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?**


The company will need to fill a total of 72, 458 positions. They can expect 25,916 Senior Engineers, 24926 Senior Staff, 9285 Engineers, 7636 Staff, 3603 Technique Leaders, 1090 Assistant Engineers and 2 Managers. 

**o	Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?**


They have 1549 Employees eligible for the Mentorship program. This would mean that they would have to mentor 46 to 47 new employees to replace the 72, 458. This seems like a tough task to ask of the mentors to do over a few years.
